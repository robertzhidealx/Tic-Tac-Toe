# Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a simple implementation of the two-player [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe,) game.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a n x n grid (usually 3 x 3). The player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
